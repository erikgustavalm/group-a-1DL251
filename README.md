A UU-GAME game platform is the game interface. It must allow human players to play a local UU-GAME. That is, it must show the game interface (e.g., the board, the stones already placed on it, ...) and control the game state (e.g., who must play next, if the game has finished, ...) and verify the outcome. Check with the product owner the specific rules and constrains.
